\section{Introduction}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{R-CNN}
~\cite{RCNN} addressed the R-CNN detector which promote the accuracy of nueral networks for object detection. This R-CNN detector combines a region proposal part (Selective Search~\cite{SelectiveSearch}), a CNN feature extractor and a classifer. R-CNN detector surmount conventional detectors in the aspect of accuracy but its speed is limited by generating massive region proposals and extracting features using CNN on each of the region proposal. 

Spatial pyramid pooling (SPP)~\cite{SPP} introduced a way to meliorate by employ pyramid pooling layer. SPP-net speed up the detector by computing CNN only once per image. Imitating SPP-net, Fast-RCNN ~\cite{fastRCNN} shown that using multi-task learning and back-propagation through ROI pooling layer will speed up the R-CNN detector by an order of magnitude. 

The bottleneck of Fast-RCNN is conventional region proposal generator, so Faster-RCNN ~\cite{fasterRCNN} proposed Region Proposal Network (RPN) which sharing features with classifer network.


\subsection{Region Proposal}
Most traditional region proposal methods are based on low-level features. Faster-RCNN introduced Region Proposal Network (RPN) to generate region proposals based on high-level semantic features. RPN surpass conventional region proposal methods, either unsupervised method (e.g. Selective Search~\cite{SelectiveSearch}) or supervised method (e.g. BING~\cite{BING}), on both speed and accuracy.

There are several approach of refining region proposals.

\subsubsection{cascade refinement}
Region Proposal Network can be refined by applying a multi-stage cascading pipeline structure.

CRAFT~\cite{CRAFT} uses a two-class Fast R-CNN to refine proposals generate by a standard RPN, and ~\cite{CraftingGBD} improved CRAFT. DeepBox~\cite{DeepBox} rerank proposals produced by EdgeBoxes ~\cite{EdgeBoxes} to refine proposals. DeepProposal~\cite{DeepProposal} introduce a Cascading Deep Convolutional Layers to get feature maps. Similar to CRAFT, ~\cite{Cascadedcnn} proposes a RefineNet added after RPN which can effectively reduce the number of proposals and improve their confidence. MTCNN~\cite{MTCNN} apply similar approach, using a R-net to refine P-net.

~\cite{GroupRecursive} introduce a spatial correlation related method, using a new EM-like group recursive learing approach to iteratively refine object proposals and provide an optimal spatial configuration of object detections.
\subsubsection{multi-scale refinment}
Methods like SDP,SSH or MS-CNN ~\cite{SDP}~\cite{SSH}~\cite{MSCNN}make independent prodictions at different layers, which will ensure smaller objects are trained on higher resolution layers.


Other methods like FPN, RetinaNet~\cite{FPN}~\cite{RetinaNet} propose a pyramidal structure to combine shallow layer with deep layer to get both high-level feature and low-level feature.

\subsection{ROI and NMS}
CoupleNet~\cite{CoupleNet} propose a two branch network of ROI after RPN to obtain both local part information and global imformation.



\section{Our approach}
\subsection{Aspect Ratio}
% Insert an image of the different aspect ratio
We have count the sapect ratio of different classes on different dataset. All datasets contain certain classes whose aspect ratio show obvious uneven distribution among different shapes. 
% For example, in MSCOCO 2017, the majority of the ball is of the shape 1*1, only a few sample gets to 1*2 and 2*1.


\subsection{Network Architure}
To include aspect ratio as the prior knowledge for object detection. We modified the network architure by duplicating the RPN network such that different network would propose objects of different shapes.
% Insert the netowrk architure

Our approach shows an significant increase of aspect ratio sensitive class.

\section{First Section}
\subsection{A Subsection Sample}
Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is
not indented. The first paragraph that follows a table, figure,
equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

\subsubsection{Sample Heading (Third Level)} Only two levels of
headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered;
they are formatted as run-in headings.

\paragraph{Sample Heading (Fourth Level)}
The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

\begin{table}
\caption{Table captions should be placed above the
tables.}\label{tab1}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Heading level &  Example & Font size and style\\
\hline
Title (centered) &  {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes} & 14 point, bold\\
1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\
2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area} & 10 point, bold\\
3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold\\
4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows & 10 point, italic\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\noindent Displayed equations are centered and set on a separate
line.
\begin{equation}
x + y = z
\end{equation}
Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and
schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see
Fig.~\ref{fig1}).

\begin{figure}

Please note that short captions are centered, while long ones are
justified by the macro package automatically.} \label{fig1}

\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.
\end{theorem}
%
% the environments 'definition', 'lemma', 'proposition', 'corollary',
% 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.
%
\begin{proof}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font.
\end{proof}
For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
% articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{ref_lncs1}, a
% book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
% and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
% \cite{ref_article1,ref_lncs1,ref_book1},
% \cite{ref_article1,ref_book1,ref_proc1,ref_url1}.

% BibTeX users should specify bibliography style 'splncs04'.
% References will then be sorted and formatted in the correct style.
